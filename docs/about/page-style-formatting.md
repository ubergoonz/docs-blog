# :material-palette: Page Style and Formating

## Overview
This page provides guidelines for styling and formatting content within the documentation. Consistent styling helps improve readability and user experience.

## Text Formatting

- **Headings**: Uses headings to structure content. Use `#` for main headings, `##` for subheadings, and so on.
- **Bold Text**: Uses `**bold text**` to emphasize important points.
- *Italic Text*: Uses `*italic text*` for emphasis or to denote titles of works.
- `Inline Code`: Uses backticks to format inline code snippets.
- ```Code Blocks```: Use triple backticks for larger code blocks or examples.
- Lists: Uses `-` or `*` for bullet points, and numbers for ordered lists.
- Links: Uses `[link text](URL)` to create hyperlinks.
- Images: Uses `![alt text](image URL)` to embed images.
- Blockquotes: Uses `>` to create blockquotes for quoting text.
- Horizontal Rules: Uses `---` or `***` to create horizontal lines for separation.
- Tables: Uses pipes `|` to create tables, with headers separated by dashes.
- Emojis: Uses `:emoji_name:` to include emojis for visual appeal.
- Footnotes: Uses `[^1]` for footnotes, with the reference at the bottom of the page.

## Code Formatting

- Uses consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces) for code blocks.
- Uses comments within code to explain complex logic.
- Uses meaningful variable and function names.
- Document code with comments to explain its purpose and usage.
- Uses syntax highlighting for code blocks by specifying the language after the opening triple backticks (e.g., ```python).
- Avoid long lines of code; break them into multiple lines for better readability.
