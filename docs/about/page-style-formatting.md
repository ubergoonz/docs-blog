# :material-palette: Page Style and Formating

## Overview
This page provides guidelines for styling and formatting content within the documentation. Consistent styling helps improve readability and user experience.

## Text Formatting
- **Headings**: Use headings to structure content. Use `#` for main headings, `##` for subheadings, and so on.
- **Bold Text**: Use `**bold text**` to emphasize important points.
- *Italic Text*: Use `*italic text*` for emphasis or to denote titles of works.
- `Inline Code`: Use backticks to format inline code snippets.
- ```Code Blocks```: Use triple backticks for larger code blocks or examples.
- Lists: Use `-` or `*` for bullet points, and numbers for ordered lists.
- Links: Use `[link text](URL)` to create hyperlinks.
- Images: Use `![alt text](image URL)` to embed images.
- Blockquotes: Use `>` to create blockquotes for quoting text.
- Horizontal Rules: Use `---` or `***` to create horizontal lines for separation.
- Tables: Use pipes `|` to create tables, with headers separated by dashes.
- Emojis: Use `:emoji_name:` to include emojis for visual appeal.
- Footnotes: Use `[^1]` for footnotes, with the reference at the bottom of the page.

## Code Formatting
- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces) for code blocks.
- Use comments within code to explain complex logic.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Document code with comments to explain its purpose and usage.
- Use syntax highlighting for code blocks by specifying the language after the opening triple backticks (e.g., ```python).
- Avoid long lines of code; break them into multiple lines for better readability.
