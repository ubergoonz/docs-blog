I work at the intersection of business and technology, bringing innovative solutions to solve complex problems.

I started off in Enterprise Computing environment as a UNIX System Administrator specialising in multiple UNIX variants. I have since evolved into an Infrastructure specialist and technology leader with domain expertise on various infrastructure disciplines on naming service, authorisation and authentications, operational autonomics and operational intelligence. 

I have move on to other domains on improvising IT service delivery by using process optimisation frameworks, sound methodologies and emerging technologies to achieve efficiencies.

I have experiences in managing people across multiple countries and diverse teams with and without line authority.

In the last 5 years, I worked in my various roles on transforming traditional system administration  from managing system configurations into managing system dynamics. I developed an agile  service delivery framework adopted from SCRUM methodology to help managing our projects, introduced open source or emerging technologies and tools into infrastructure space for automation, orchestration and to develop operational intelligence and autonomic capability.
