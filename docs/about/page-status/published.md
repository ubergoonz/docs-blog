# :simple-statuspage: Published

> The icon displayed on the side navigation does not represent the status of the page. Instead, it is a static icon that does not change based on the page's status.

<span class="md-ellipsis"> The icon <span class="md-status md-status--published" title="Page is complete and published"> </span> </span> denotes that the page is complete and has been published. It contains all the necessary information and is ready for public viewing.

The Frontmatter section is formatted as follows:

```yaml

status: published
