# :simple-statuspage: New

> The icon displayed on the side navigation does not represent the status of the page. Instead, it is a static icon that does not change based on the page's status.

<span class="md-ellipsis"> The icon <span class="md-status md-status--new" title="Newly created page"> </span> </span> denotes that the page is new. It is in the early stages of development and may not have all the content or features that will be available in the final version. Users should expect updates and changes as the page evolves.
Please note that the content is subject to change, and it may not be fully functional yet. We appreciate your patience as we work on finalizing this page.

The Frontmatter section is formatted as follows:
