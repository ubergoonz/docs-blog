???+ abstract

    I started using my first computer in 1980s on a [PC-XT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer_XT){:target="_blank"} (1) [compatiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible){:target="_blank"}(2) running [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS){:target="_blank"}(3). So I have a long history with computers and Operating Systems in Command Line. I have used many different Operating Systems, but my favorite ones are the `*nix` family of Operating Systems.
