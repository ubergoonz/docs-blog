      Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie (September 9, 1941 ‚Äì c. October 12, 2011) was an American computer scientist and winner, with Kenneth Thompson, of the 1983 Turing Award. He created the C programming language and, with Thompson, the Unix operating system, which have had pervasive and lasting influence on subsequent programming languages and operating systems.

Over the years, I‚Äôve explored various Unix and Linux distributions, each shaping my understanding and skills in the world of open-source software. Here's a quick timeline of my journey through the different operating systems I‚Äôve used since 1997.

My first encounter with computers was with a PC-XT running MS-DOS in the mid-90s during  school. I was fascinated by the command line and the power it offered, but stopped using any computer for years until I joined my Nation Services in 1994.

As a Staff Assistant during National Services, I have to use a PC running MS-DOS 6.22 and Windows 3.11 for work, and learned to discover the Internet, but I didn't have much exposure to Unix or Linux at that time.

Thanks to the Internet, I was able to learn more about Unix and Linux, and I started to explore the world of open-source software.

## 1997 - 1999: The Beginnings üöÄ

> I started my Unix journey with a mix of different systems, primarily in a military simulation context.
> The simulator systems are maded up of interconnected Unix servers, and I was introduced to the world of Unix through these systems.
> I learned the basics of Unix commands, shell scripting, and system administration.

- **OS**: IBM AIX, Sun Microsystems SunOS 1.4.1, SGI IRIX 6.2, SysV UNIX, DEC Ultrix
- **Why**: First exposure to Unix systems working as a Data Modeller on military simulation systems, learning the basics of command-line interfaces and system administration.
- **Memories**:
      - The thrill of using `vi` for the first time, and the confusion of dealing with different Unix flavors.
      - Learning about file permissions and the power of shell scripting.
      - The joy of compiling kernel because we need to expand storage on SunOS, even if it took hours to get right!
      - Wrote my first shell scripts to automate tasks, like backups and log management

## 2001 - 2004: The Enterprise Era üêß

- **OS**: SunOS, Solaris, NeXTSTEP, Free BSD, Red Hat Linux, Debian
- **Why**: Transitioning from military simulation systems to enterprise environments, focusing on server management and administration. I've also started dual booting into Linux on my personal computer.
- **Memories**:
      - Setting up my first NFS cluster on Solaris with Veritas HA for CLearCase, and the challenges of managing networked file systems.
      - The excitement of using NeXTSTEP for the first time, with its unique interface and development environment.
      - Learning about system security and the importance of patch management.
      - Exposed to Directory Services like NIS, DNS, Netinfo, Kerberos and LDAP, which became crucial for managing user accounts and network resources.
      - The excitement of using Slackware for the first time, compiling everything from source.
      - Learning about RPM packages and the importance of system security.

## 2005 - 2008: Enterprise Linux Introduction  üåü

- **OS**: Solaris 8, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4, 5, 6
- **Why**: Focused on enterprise Linux solutions, learning about system administration, virtualization, and network management.
- **Memories**:
      - The transition from Solaris to RHEL, and the challenges of adapting to a new environment.
      - Setting up my first virtual machines using Xen on RHEL 5, which opened up new possibilities for server management.
      - The thrill of using `yum` for package management, making software installation and updates much easier.
      - Learning about SELinux and its role in enhancing system security.
  
## 2009 - 2012: Linux Takeover üì¶

- **OS**: RHEL 6, CentOS 5, 6, Fedora 12, 13, 14, Ubuntu, macOS X
- **Why**: Experimented with bleeding-edge software on Fedora and stable, production-ready environments on CentOS.
- **Memories**: First experience with SELinux and extensive web hosting setup.

## 2017 - Present: Ubuntu LTS & Manjaro üõ†Ô∏è
- **OS**: Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OSa, WSL
- **Why**: Balancing stability (Ubuntu) 
- **Memories**: A smooth and productive environment for both work and personal projects.
